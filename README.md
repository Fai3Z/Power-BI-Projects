## Problem Statement

This dashboard contains data from clinical trials conducted worldwide. It contains data pertaining to each trial conducted for instance facilities where trials were conducted, investigator and scientist information, sources of study, descriptions of trials and related documents. The source o this data is AACT who has made the data available for public use.

The dashboard gives key indicators i.e total subjects enrolled, withdraw rate, and trials conducted per country. By understanding the nature of trails conducted in a country, we can make intelligent decisions relating to which kinds of diseases are prevalent in those countries and what kinds of devices, pharmaceuticals are being researched on.


### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a series of csv files.
- Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality" & "column profile" options.
- Step 3 : Also since by default, profile will be opened only for 1000 rows so you need to select "column profiling based on entire dataset".
- Step 4 : Clean the data, remove unnecessary coulmns, or ones with too many nulls.
- Step 5 : Transform data by performing relative operations.
- Step 6 : In the report view, under the view tab, theme was selected.
- Step 7 : Establish the data model and relationships.
- Step 8 : Write DAX queries to relate the data and make complex calculations based on relationships of data we want answers to.
- Step 9 : Made the visuals based on data which was required by stakeholders.
           Using visual level filter from the filters pane, basic filtering was used & null values were unselected for consideration into average calculation.
           
           Although, by default, while calculating average, blank values are ignored.

# Insights

A five page report was created on Power BI Desktop & it was then published to Power BI Service.

Following inferences can be drawn from the dashboard;

### [1] Total Number of Subjects i Trials = 2.43 billion

   Number of trials conducted worldwide (As of 2024): 412852.
           
### [2] Total number of trials conducted by country (Top 15):

    1) United States of America: 168439 Trials
    2) France: 35218 Trials
    3) China: 33381 Trials
    4) Canada: 27949 Trials
    5) Germany: 24798 Trials
    6) United Kingdom: 24463 Trials
    7) Spain: 19997 Trials
    8) Italy: 19702 Trials
    9) Korea: 14766 Trials
    10) Turkey: 13082 Trials
    11) Belgium: 12977 Trials
    12) Netherlands: 12769 Trials
    13) Denmark: 10867 Trials
    14) Egypt: 10149 Trials
    15) Taiwan: 10045 Trials
  
  The number of trials conducted in a country gives an idea about its advancement in medical fields and biotech, countries with greater trials have better research, products and healthcare facilities in general for the public.
